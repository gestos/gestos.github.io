	Very clean page<br>

	<a href="http://chschneider.eu/linux/server/cups.shtml">This</a> guide to set up the server (has been fine already).<br>
	for the client I really only need to fill the /etc/cups/client.conf with a single "ServerName $printserver:631" line!<br>
	no cups server needs to run on the client machine.<br>

	What I've been missing on gentoo is to set the "cups" flag for gtk+. That's why firefox wouldn't show the printer, although 'lpstat -t' clearly did.<br>
	recompile with cups flag was the solution.
